\subsubsection{Environment Set Up}
\label{sect:envsetup}

After creating an SSH connection to Speed, you will need to
make sure the \tool{srun}, \tool{sbatch}, and \tool{salloc}
commands are available to you. 
Type the command name at the command prompt and press enter.
If the command is not available, e.g., (``command not found'') is returned,
you need to make sure your \api{\$PATH} has \texttt{/local/bin} in it.
To view your \api{\$PATH} type \texttt{echo \$PATH} at the prompt.
%
%source 
%the ``Altair Grid Engine (AGE)'' scheduler's settings file. 
%Sourcing the settings file will set the environment variables required to 
%execute scheduler commands.
%
%Based on the UNIX shell type, choose one of the following commands to source
%the settings file. 
%
%csh/\tool{tcsh}:
%\begin{verbatim}
%source /local/pkg/uge-8.6.3/root/default/common/settings.csh 
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Bourne shell/\tool{bash}:
%\begin{verbatim}
%. /local/pkg/uge-8.6.3/root/default/common/settings.sh 
%\end{verbatim}
%
%In order to set up the default ENCS bash shell, executing the following command 
%is also required:
%\begin{verbatim}
%printenv ORGANIZATION | grep -qw ENCS || . /encs/Share/bash/profile 
%\end{verbatim}
%
%To verify that you have access to the scheduler commands execute 
%\texttt{qstat -f -u "*"}. If an error is returned, attempt sourcing 
%the settings file again.

The next step is to copy a job template to your home directory and to set up your
cluster-specific storage. Execute the following command from within your
home directory. (To move to your home directory, type \texttt{cd} at the Linux
prompt and press \texttt{Enter}.) 

\begin{verbatim}
cp /home/n/nul-uge/template.sh . && mkdir /speed-scratch/$USER
\end{verbatim}

%\textbf{Tip:} Add the source command to your shell-startup script. 

\textbf{Tip:} the default shell for GCS ENCS users is \tool{tcsh}.
If you would like to use \tool{bash}, please contact 
\texttt{rt-ex-hpc AT encs.concordia.ca}.

%For \textbf{new GCS ENCS Users}, and/or those who don't have a shell-startup script, 
%based on your shell type use one of the following commands to copy a start up script 
%from \texttt{nul-uge}'s home directory to your home directory. (To move to your home
%directory, type \tool{cd} at the Linux prompt and press \texttt{Enter}.)

%csh/\tool{tcsh}:
%\begin{verbatim}
%cp /home/n/nul-uge/.tcshrc . 
%\end{verbatim}

%Bourne shell/\tool{bash}:
%\begin{verbatim}
%cp /home/n/nul-uge/.bashrc . 
%\end{verbatim}

%Users who already have a shell-startup script, can use a text editor, such as
%\tool{vim} or \tool{emacs}, to add the source request to your existing
%shell-startup environment (i.e., to the \file{.tcshrc} file in your home directory). 

%csh/\tool{tcsh}:
%Sample \file{.tcshrc} file:
%\begin{verbatim}
%# Speed environment set up 
%if ($HOSTNAME == speed-submit.encs.concordia.ca) then
   %source /local/pkg/uge-8.6.3/root/default/common/settings.csh
%endif
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Bourne shell/\tool{bash}:
%Sample \file{.bashrc} file:
%\begin{verbatim}
%# Speed environment set up 
%if [ $HOSTNAME = "speed-submit.encs.concordia.ca" ]; then
    %. /local/pkg/uge-8.6.3/root/default/common/settings.sh
    %printenv ORGANIZATION | grep -qw ENCS || . /encs/Share/bash/profile
%fi
%\end{verbatim}

Note, if you are getting ``command not found'' error(s) when logging in, you
probably have old Grid Engine environment commands. Remove them
as per \xa{appdx:uge-to-slurm}.
